<h1 align="center"> Human centered ROS package for <br> Human Robot Interaction </h1>

## General Dependencies
- ROS (tested on Ubuntu1804/Melodic)
- catkin
- python/cpp
- pybullet
- GPU (tested on GeForce 1050 for only one perception module)
- RGB-D camera (in order to compute 3D body poses)

## ROS Topics 
- /humans/poses/body/2D
- /humans/poses/body/3D
- /humans/poses/body/3D/markers
- /humans/poses/gaze/3D
- /humans/poses/gaze/3D/markers
- /humans/visual_attention
- /humans/memory

## Vocabulary
- Body: parts of the body
- Gaze: gaze estimation
- Complete body: parts of the body + gaze estimation
- Center of attention: perfect projection along the gaze estimation (Point XYZ)
- Visual attention: current attention of one human
- Memory: cumulated visual attention over the time
